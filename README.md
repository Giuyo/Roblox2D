Create your own 2D game on ROBLOX!

Hello! Welcome to this very cool library for coding your ROBLOX 2D game. There are a bunch of working functions!
# Setting up Roblox2D
(Note that this is not out yet so please wait when we make the game for sale)

Let's start setting up! You first have to get the most suitable version and set it up with `require()`. Easy, right?
# Shapes
This one is very easy, you just spawn a shape and set the color.
```lua
roblox.square(255, 255, 255, false)
```
The numbers mean the color (RGB) and the false means if It's clickable or not. If It's set to true, people will be able to click it.
