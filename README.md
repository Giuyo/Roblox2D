# Roblox2D
Create your own 2D game on ROBLOX!

Hello! Welcome to this very cool library for coding your ROBLOX 2D game. There are a bunch of working functions!
# Setting up Roblox2D
(Note that this is not out yet so please wait when we make the game for sale)

Let's start setting up! You first have to get the most suitable version and set it up with `require()`. Easy, right?
# Examples
You can spawn shapes, images and print text
```lua
roblox.square("White Square", 255, 255, 255, false)
roblox.newImage("Roblox2D Logo", "http://www.roblox.com/asset/?id=15228183036", false)
roblox:print("Text", "Hi!! :D", 255, 255, 255, false, Enum.Font.PatrickHand)
```
The first strings are the name, the numbers are the RGB color and false bool is not clickable (If you want it clickable, set it to true).
